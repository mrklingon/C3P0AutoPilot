Simple "mouse jiggler" for playing arcade games in a browser.

Designed to take over playing a simple game, for example: https://makecode.com/_JfAKKf2EUcLv
This game lets you steer the Millenium Falcon, and shoot asteroids and Star Destroyers.

Touch #1 on the NeoTrinkey to fire lasers, and touch #2 to toggle on a random "jiggler" that moves the ship around, randomly shooting.

Touch #1 ad #2 together to end program.

Flashes green when autopilot is engaged, and red when it ends. Ending program flashes gold.
